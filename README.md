# Project HTML & CSS â€” My Portfolio

This project is my personal portfolio web-page. It contains information about me - my career and aspirations, strengths and skills. Furthermore, to show you practical skills I developed, protfolio section will send you to a couple of projects that I worked on. If all that will make you interested in getting to know me or working together - you will be one click away from seeing my resume and contacting me! My phone number and email address are available on the webpage, or if you like, you can fill the form and send me a message straight from the web page. So come on in and get to know me!
